# Custom Crypto Backend Guide

## Goal

This guide explains how to add a custom crypto backend, including audited BLS and VRF adapters.

`vexo-consensus` ships the adapter contracts, registry hooks, metadata validation, and runtime wiring. It does not ship an audited BLS or VRF implementation. A chain binary that wants those backends must link an external audited adapter package and register it before node startup.

## Interfaces

Implement:

```go
type Signer interface {
    PublicKey() types.PublicKey
    Sign(message []byte) (types.Signature, error)
    Verify(publicKey types.PublicKey, message []byte, signature types.Signature) bool
}

type AggregateSigner interface {
    Aggregate(signatures []types.Signature) (types.AggregateSignature, error)
    VerifyAggregate(publicKeys []types.PublicKey, message []byte, signature types.AggregateSignature) bool
}
```

## Runtime Suite

A backend must provide:

- consensus signer
- finality verifier
- consensus aggregator
- key validation
- deterministic serialization

## Domain Separation

All signatures must use explicit domains:

- `vexo.consensus.proposal.v1`
- `vexo.consensus.vote.v1`
- `vexo.consensus.timeout_vote.v1`
- `vexo.finality.proof.v1`

Never sign raw messages directly in production paths.

## Production BLS Requirements

A BLS adapter must include:

- audited library dependency
- public key validation
- signature validation
- subgroup checks
- proof-of-possession or equivalent rogue-key defense
- domain separation
- deterministic aggregate encoding
- dependency audit for the adapter and transitive crypto dependencies
- test vectors
- fuzz tests for malformed keys/signatures

Production BLS is registered through `BLSAdapter` and must pass `ValidateBLSAdapter` before it can be used as a signer or runtime finality backend. Adapter metadata must declare audit status, audit report identity, dependency audit identity, public-key validation, subgroup checks, rogue-key defense, deterministic encoding, malformed-input fuzz coverage, and proof-of-possession support.

Registering metadata is not a substitute for a real audited implementation. The adapter package must perform the actual subgroup checks, key validation, proof-of-possession verification, signature verification, aggregate verification, and malformed-input rejection.

Adapter packages should register audited implementations from `init()`:

```go
func init() {
    crypto.RegisterBLSAdapter("audited-bls-v1", func() (crypto.BLSAdapter, error) {
        return NewAuditedBLSAdapter()
    })
}
```

`crypto.adapter_name` must match `BLSAdapter.Metadata().Name`; otherwise runtime startup fails. This prevents config-only “BLS enabled” states where no audited implementation is actually linked into the binary.

Validator public keys should be admitted through `BLSValidatorCredential` records or validator metadata key `bls_pop`. `ValidateBLSValidatorCredentials` rejects missing IDs, missing keys, duplicate public keys, invalid keys, and invalid proof-of-possession values. `NewBLSAggregateVerifier` wraps the audited adapter so finality verification only accepts registered validator keys.

## Production VRF Requirements

VRF-backed committee selection uses the same registration pattern:

```go
func init() {
    crypto.RegisterVRFAdapter("audited-vrf-v1", func(cfg config.VRFConfig) (crypto.VRFAdapter, error) {
        return NewAuditedVRFAdapter(cfg)
    })
}
```

`vrf.adapter_name`, `vrf.audit_report`, and `vrf.key_source` must match the adapter metadata. When `committee.backend` is `vrf`, runtime startup fails if no matching adapter is linked instead of silently falling back to deterministic VRF. When committee selection is deterministic, runtime does not load a VRF adapter.

As with BLS, the framework only provides the registry and validation boundary. The linked VRF adapter must provide the cryptographic proof generation, proof verification, key management boundary, and audit evidence.

## Remote Signer Requirements

Remote signers must enforce their own policy tuple:

```text
(chain_id, height, round, type, domain)
```

They must reject conflicting messages for the same tuple even if the node process restarts or is compromised.

`vexo-consensus` also provides a node-side and HTTP KMS/HSM `DoubleSignGuard` helper. For built-in serving, run `vexod keys serve-remote` with a durable `--guard-path`; external production KMS/HSM implementations must keep an equivalent durable policy database. The guard key includes domain separation:

```text
chain_id/height/round/type/domain
```

Valid sign type and domain pairs are:

- `consensus_proposal` → `vexo.consensus.proposal.v1`
- `consensus_vote` → `vexo.consensus.vote.v1`
- `consensus_timeout_vote` → `vexo.consensus.timeout_vote.v1`
- `finality_proof` → `vexo.finality.proof.v1`

## Development Backends

`deterministic` is test-only. It must not pass network safety validation and must not be used for value-bearing deployments.
