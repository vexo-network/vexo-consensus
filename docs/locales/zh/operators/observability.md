## Overview

本文说明如何通过状态、指标、日志和告警判断 Vexo 节点是否健康。

This localized guide keeps commands, JSON fields, RPC methods, config keys, and package names unchanged so examples remain copy-pasteable across languages.

## 为什么重要

Vexo combines BFT consensus, application modules, native accounting, optional EVM execution, validator economics, peer networking, and release evidence. A reader should be able to explain not just that a feature exists, but how to operate it safely and how to prove that it works on the target network.

## 必须验证

- **Height and finality**: `latest_height`, `latest_finalized_height`, height rate, and finality proof availability show whether consensus and execution are progressing.
- **Peer health**: `peer_count` is compatibility summary; prefer `active_peer_count`, `configured_peer_count`, and `scored_peer_count` to separate live sessions from configured addresses.
- **Latency and timeout**: `round_timeouts`, proposal latency, vote latency, and commit latency show whether timeout values still fit the real network.
- **Execution pressure**: `mempool_size`, gas/base-fee behavior, tx count, and commit p95/p99 show whether block capacity and storage are under pressure.
- **Recovery readiness**: `snapshot_healthy`, `replay_healthy`, recovery reports, and state-root checks show whether a node can safely restart or sync.
- **Custody and safety**: `validator_signing_failures`, remote signer logs, ban spikes, and reconciliation failures require immediate operator review.

## 运维动作

- **Status flow**: Start with `/v1/status`, then compare `/v1/metrics`, `/metrics/text`, `/v1/diagnostics`, `/v1/finality/latest`, and recovery reports.
- **Alert flow**: Alert on stalled height, stalled finality, zero active peers, timeout spikes, high commit latency, mempool pressure, replay failure, and signer failures.
- **Incident flow**: Preserve logs, metrics, configs, genesis, binary hash, and evidence files before deleting data or restarting repeatedly.

## Interface names kept unchanged

- `vexod validate --home <home>`
- `vexod config audit --home <home> --strict`
- `/v1/status`
- `/v1/metrics`
- `/metrics/text`
- `/v1/diagnostics`
- `peer_count`
- `active_peer_count`
- `configured_peer_count`
- `scored_peer_count`
- `latest_height`
- `latest_finalized_height`
- `network_config.json`
- `consensus_config.json`
- `module_config.json`
- `mempool_config.json`
- `release gate`

## Common mistakes

- Do not assume configured peers are connected peers; active sessions must be checked separately.
- Do not call BLS, VRF, EVM, state sync, or governance production-ready without release evidence.
- Do not use private operator shortcuts, managed hot keys, or local-only settings on public RPC/P2P listeners.
- Do not delete node data before collecting recovery reports, logs, and evidence when an incident happens.
